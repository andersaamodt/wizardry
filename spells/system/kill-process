# This spell lists running processes and interactively chooses one to terminate.
# It prompts with ask cantrips and sends a kill signal, customizable via KILL_CMD.


kill_process_usage() {
cat <<'USAGE'
Usage: kill-process

List running processes, prompt you to pick one by number, and then send a kill signal to that PID. Uses ask-number and ask-yn for a gentle, confirmed termination, and you can override the signal command with KILL_CMD.
