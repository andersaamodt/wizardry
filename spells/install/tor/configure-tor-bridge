# Instructions and warning
cat << EOF
This script will enable or disable bridge mode for your Tor relay.

Becoming a bridge relay helps users in countries that block access to the Tor network. 
However, be aware that this could increase your network traffic and may have other unforeseen consequences.

Make sure to review the Tor documentation and fully understand the implications before proceeding.
