Usage: setup-https SITENAME

Guides you through setting up HTTPS with Let's Encrypt for a website.

This is an interactive wrapper around the 'https' spell that:
  1. Confirms you're on a production server with a proper domain
  2. Collects necessary information (email, domain)
  3. Sets up HTTPS using Let's Encrypt

Prerequisites:
  - certbot must be installed
  - Domain must be publicly accessible and pointing to this server
  - Port 80 must be available for ACME challenge

Example: web-setup-https mysite
