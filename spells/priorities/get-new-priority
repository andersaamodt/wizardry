# This spell determines the next appropriate priority for a file in a directory.
# Use it to find what priority value to assign when adding a file to a priority list.

Usage: get-new-priority <file>

Compute the next priority value for a file within its directory's list. It looks at existing priorities and returns the highest value plus one, or 1 if none exist.
