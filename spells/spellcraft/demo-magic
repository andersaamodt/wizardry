# Demonstrate wizardry spells at specified levels with narrated output.
# Each demo level corresponds to a banish level and demonstrates the spells
# that are validated and tested by that banish level.

# Demo a single level using spell-levels data

# Detect WIZARDRY_DIR if not set (for direct execution)
# This must be done BEFORE demo_magic function so castable loading can find it

# Main script logic (unwrapped from demo_magic function)
