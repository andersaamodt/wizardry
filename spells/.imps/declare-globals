# Centralized declaration of allowed global environment variables.
# Each global requires two comment lines: description and justification.
#
# ENFORCEMENT: Tests in test-suite.sh verify:
# 1. Exactly 3 globals are declared here (test_declare_globals_count)
# 2. Scripts using these globals have 'set -u' enabled (test_scripts_using_globals_have_set_u)
# 3. No undeclared globals are exported (test_no_undeclared_global_exports)
# 4. No global declarations outside this file (test_no_global_declarations_outside_declare_globals)
# This creates a closed enforcement loop that prevents undeclared globals.
