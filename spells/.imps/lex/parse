# parse CMD... - recursively parse and execute written imperatives
# Scans for linking words (imps in lex/) and delegates to them.
# Longer linking words take precedence (and-then before and or then).
#
# The parse imp is automatically used by glosses and should not normally be
# called directly by users. It handles command resolution and recursion
# prevention for the glossary system.
#
# Usage (via glosses): Any wizardry command
# Usage (direct): parse <command> [args...]
#
# Current mode: PASSTHROUGH (parsing disabled for glossary-based interception paradigm)
# Linking word detection is logged when WIZARDRY_DEBUG=1 but not acted upon yet.
#
# RECURSION PREVENTION: Uses WIZARDRY_PARSE_DEPTH to prevent infinite loops
