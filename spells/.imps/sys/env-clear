# env-clear - marker for environment variable policy compliance
# Indicates spell follows no-env-var-passing policy.
# Actual enforcement is done by test_no_allcaps_variable_assignments test.
# Usage: . env-clear (must be sourced, call after set -eu)

# This is intentionally a no-op. The presence of this call is checked by tests.
# Runtime enforcement isn't feasible because clearing env vars from a sourced
# script also affects local variables in the calling function's scope.
# 
# Instead, we rely on:
# 1. test_no_allcaps_variable_assignments - prevents ALL_CAPS local variables
# 2. test_spells_declare_env_clear_compliance - requires this marker
# 3. Code review - ensures no env var passing between scripts
