# Start monitoring room activity in the background for real-time notifications.

Usage: start-listening [room_path]

Start a background process that monitors the .room.log file in the current
(or specified) directory and displays new entries in real-time.

This enables live MUD multiplayer notifications - when other players speak,
cast spells, or perform actions, you see them immediately in your terminal.

The listener runs as a background process and continues until you call
stop-listening or exit the shell.

Examples:
  start-listening                    # Monitor current directory
  start-listening /mnt/portals/server/dungeon
