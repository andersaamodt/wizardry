# This spell moves the cursor to the provided column (x) and row (y).



# Use conditional strictness based on execution context
# See .github/CODE_POLICY_SET_EU.md for details





# Validate that both coordinates are purely numeric.


# ANSI escape sequences count from 1, so reject zero values early.
# The original menu spell passed 0 for the column. Treat that as a request to
# return to the first column so older spells continue to work. Clamp the row as
# well so callers that miscalculate never request an invalid position.



# Emit the escape sequence that repositions the cursor.
