Usage: mark-location [marker] [path]
       mark [marker] [path]

Record the absolute path (current directory by default) for jump-to-marker to
return to later. Markers are stored in ~/.spellbook/markers/.

Arguments:
  marker  Optional name or number for the marker. If omitted, uses the next
          available number (auto-increments). Use any alphanumeric name.
  path    Optional path to mark. If omitted, marks the current directory.

Examples:
  mark-location           # Mark current dir as next number (e.g., "1")
  mark-location alpha     # Mark current dir as "alpha"
  mark-location 5         # Mark current dir as "5"
  mark-location home ~    # Mark home directory as "home"
