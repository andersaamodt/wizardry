# Ward the system against common security vulnerabilities.
# Checks security configurations at three levels: recommended, advanced, and expert.
#
# NOTE: ward-system uses its own 3-level system (1-3) which is independent
# from wizardry's general spell-levels system. These levels represent
# security check severity, not spell complexity.

  cat <<'USAGE'
Usage: ward-system [LEVEL] [OPTIONS]

Check and fix system security issues at different threat levels.
Supports Linux and macOS systems.

NOTE: ward-system levels (1-3) are independent from wizardry's spell-levels.
      These represent security check severity, not spell complexity.

Arguments:
  LEVEL                 Security level to check (1-3, all, default: 1)
                        1 = Recommended (essential security)
                        2 = Advanced (additional hardening)
                        3 = Expert (obscure/dangerous checks)
                        all = Run all levels (1, 2, and 3)

Options:
  -v, --verbose         Show full descriptions even for passing checks
  --no-fix              Only report issues, do not offer fixes

Levels:
  1 (Recommended)       Essential security checks for all systems
  2 (Advanced)          Additional hardening for security-conscious users
  3 (Expert)            Obscure and potentially dangerous checks

Examples:
  ward-system           # Check level 1 only (recommended)
  ward-system 2         # Check level 2 only (advanced)
  ward-system all       # Check all levels (1, 2, and 3)
  ward-system 3 -v      # Check level 3 only with verbose output
  ward-system 1 --no-fix # Only report level 1 issues
