# This spell will teach you how to work with environment variables in POSIX-compliant Bash
# This spell will teach you about environment variables, which are variables that are accessible to all processes running in the operating system. They store information such as system paths, user preferences, and other settings.
# Limitations on naming conventions vary by operating system, but in general, they can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores, and have a maximum length of around 1024 characters. They cannot be aliased, but they can be exported and referenced in the .bashrc file.

# This spell will teach you about environment variables and exporting in POSIX-compliant Bash
# Environment variables are variables that contain information about the environment in which a process runs. They can be used to set various options and make certain information available to processes.
# The limitations on names of environment variables are that they can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores, and the maximum length is determined by the system's limit on the length of environment variable strings. Environment variables cannot be aliased.
