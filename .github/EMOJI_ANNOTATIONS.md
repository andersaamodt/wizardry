# Emoji Annotations in AI-Facing Documentation

## Purpose
Emoji annotations serve as **marginalia**—intuitive, symbolic markers that seed emergent patterns. This is an experiment in non-verbal metadata and affective tagging.

## Scope
**ONLY** `.github/` directory (`.github/*.md`, `.github/instructions/*.md`, `.github/archive/*.md`)  
**NEVER** spells, tests, user-facing docs, or code files

## Format
Two spaces before emoji, at end of line. No spaces between multiple emojis.
```markdown
Some text requiring strict adherence.  ⚠️🔒
Optional patterns work here.  🌊~
```

## Philosophy
1. **Intuitive, not systematic** - Use what *feels* right
2. **Symbolic over literal** - Metaphorical associations
3. **Embrace contradiction** - 🚫✅ both forbidden and approved
4. **No consistency required** - Different vocabularies per file
5. **Exploratory** - Pattern seeding, not clarification

**Goal**: Seed patterns, enable discovery via `catalog-emojis`, invite interpretation, surface intuition.

## Examples
```markdown
POSIX compliance is non-negotiable.  ⚖️🔒
Consider abstracting when reused.  🌊💭
NEVER duplicate set -eu.  ⚠️⚠️🔥
Spells are scrolls—readable top to bottom.  📜🌊
Tests required... except bootstrap.  🔒~
```

## Viewing Patterns
```sh
catalog-emojis         # Frequency table
catalog-emojis --verbose  # Per-file counts
```

## Emoji Observatory (Instructions)

Maintain this section as a running aggregation of emoji usage across the project. Whenever emojis appear in documentation or code, update this section to reflect their frequency, co-occurrence, and distribution by file or context. Do not define meanings or enforce consistency; simply record patterns, notable clusters, shifts over time, and emergent regularities. Treat this as an observational ledger of how emoji usage evolves, not a glossary or standard.

### Observation Log

**2026-01-01: Initial Baseline**
- Total unique emojis: 167
- Total instances: 387
- Files annotated: 18 (primarily `.github/` documentation)

**High-frequency markers (>10 instances):**
- ✅ (92×) - Correctness, approval patterns
- ❌ (47×) - Incorrectness, forbidden patterns  
- ✓ (14×) - Verification, checks
- ⚠️ (9×) - Warnings, critical attention

**Emerging semantic clusters:**
- **Structural enforcement**: 🔒 (4×), ⚖️ (appearing with rules/compliance)
- **Testing ecosystem**: 🧪 (3×), appearing with 🔒🔥 combinations
- **Magical/thematic**: 🔮✨🌊 (mystical flow), 📜 (scrolls/spells), 👹 (imps)
- **Tool/implementation**: 🔧🔨 (tools), 🐚 (shells), 🌍 (cross-platform)
- **Affective warnings**: ⚠️🔥 (critical danger), 💀🖥️ (terminal hangs)

**Notable co-occurrences:**
- 🚫🔮 (3×) - "No guessing" on test results
- ⚠️🔥 (2×) - Escalated warnings
- 🧪🔒🔥 (1×) - Tests absolutely required
- ⚔️❤️‍🩹 (1×) - Strict but self-healing
- 🔮✨🌊 (1×) - Magical emergence

**Distribution notes:**
- copilot-instructions.md: 87 instances (highest density, core guidelines)
- instructions/spells.instructions.md: 59 instances
- instructions/imps.instructions.md: 57 instances  
- CODE_POLICY_FUNCTION_CALLS.md: 48 instances

**Patterns to watch:**
- Will 🔒 continue to cluster with non-negotiable requirements?
- Are multi-emoji sequences (3+) becoming semantic units?
- Do different instruction types develop distinct emoji vocabularies?

## Status

**Experimental**: This policy establishes emoji annotations as an ongoing experiment in non-verbal documentation metadata. Annotations should evolve organically as the documentation grows.
