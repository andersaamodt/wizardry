# Wizardry Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the spirit of the Wizard's Oath—to guard growth and ease pain—we as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in wizardry a welcoming, harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are a **teaching community**. We believe that scripts should be didactic exemplars, and that extends to how we treat each other. Every question is valid, every contributor is valued, and every spell is an opportunity to learn and share knowledge.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Writing clear, well-commented code that teaches
* Helping novices understand POSIX shell conventions
* Embracing the playful MUD/fantasy theme while maintaining professionalism
* Assuming good intent and asking for clarification before criticizing
* Celebrating contributions of all sizes

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Dismissive or condescending responses to questions
* Gatekeeping or making others feel unwelcome
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Teaching Community Values

Wizardry is built on the principle that **code encodes shared knowledge**. This means:

* **Patience with learners**: Everyone starts somewhere. If someone doesn't understand POSIX sh conventions, teach them.
* **Clear explanations**: When reviewing code, explain *why* something should change, not just *what* to change.
* **Documentation matters**: Well-commented code is better than clever code.
* **Novice-friendly**: Write spells and reviews as if teaching someone new to shell scripting.
* **Collaborative improvement**: Code review is about making spells better together, not about finding fault.

## Self-Healing Philosophy

In wizardry, we believe that spells should fix problems automatically rather than telling users what to do. This philosophy extends to our community:

* When you see a problem, offer to help fix it
* When reviewing code, suggest solutions alongside critiques
* When someone makes a mistake, help them understand and correct it
* Lead by example—show, don't just tell

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (repository, issues, pull requests, wiki, discussions) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## The Wizard's Oath in Practice

The [Wizard's Oath](/OATH) guides our interactions:

> "I will use the Art for nothing but the service of that Life. I will guard growth and ease pain."

In our community, this means:

* **Guard growth**: Help others learn and improve
* **Ease pain**: Make contributing easier, not harder
* **Service**: Put the community's needs before ego
* **Courage over fear**: Take risks, try new approaches, learn from mistakes
* **Life over death**: Build up, don't tear down
