~ THE WIZARD'S OATH ~

In Life's name and for Life's sake, I say that I will use the Art for nothing
but the service of that Life. I will guard growth and ease pain. I will
fight to preserve what grows and lives well in its own way; and I will change
no object or creature unless its growth and life, or that of the system of
which it is part, are threatened. To these ends, in the practice of my Art,
I will put aside fear for courage, and death for life, when it is right to
do so -- till Universe's end. I will look always toward the Heart of Time,
where all times are one, where all our sundered worlds lie whole, as they
were meant to be.

~ The WIZARD'S OATH (FOR CAT WIZARDS) ~

I will meet the cruel and the cowardly today, liars and the envious, the
uncaring and unknowing: they will be all around. But their numbers and
their carelessness do not mean I have to be like them. For my own part,
I know my job; my commission comes from Those Who Are. My paw raised is
Their paw on the neck of the Serpent, now and always. I shall walk through
Their worlds as do the Powers that Be, seeing and knowing with Them and
for Them, tending Their worlds as if they were mine: for so indeed they
are. Silently shall I strive to go my way, as They do, doing my work unseen;
the light needs no reminding by me of good deeds done by night. And in this
long progress through all that is, though I will know doubt and fear in the
strange places where I must walk, I will put these both aside, as the Oath
requires, and hold myself to my work ... for if They and I together cannot
mend what is marred, who can? And having done my work aright, though I may
know weariness at day's end, come awakening I shall rise up and say again,
with Them, as if surprised, "behold, the world is made new ... !"
