# Wizardry Readiness Checklist

- [x] Confirm the POSIX shell baseline and document the Bash-only menu exception.
- [ ] Publish a standard `--install` contract for spells and thread it through the global installer and menu helpers.
- [ ] Keep mud and main-menu in sync across platforms, including reliable install-menu population and forwarding.
- [ ] Replace any remaining GNU-centric assumptions in cursor, input, and menu helpers with portable checks or fallbacks.
- [ ] Exercise the read-magic/enchant/hashchant family on Debian, macOS, and NixOS until helpers agree on behaviour and error messages.
- [ ] Harden path-wizard for alternate rc files and nested directories while keeping PATH edits idempotent.
- [ ] Document the installation story and platform-specific limitations for the menu spells and supporting cantrips.
- [ ] Add unit tests for memorize covering recursive sweeps, alias recording failures, and interpreter selection edge cases.
- [ ] Add unit tests for ask_* cantrips to capture empty input handling, default selection, and NO_COLOR behaviour.
- [ ] Expand coverage for menu spells (spellbook, spell-menu, mud) to lock in prompt text and spell listing parity.
- [ ] Cover error handling paths in detect-rc-file, path-wizard, and installer wrappers so platform variance stays predictable.
- [ ] Fix POSIX violation in list-contacts (replace bash-specific `read -d` with portable alternative).
- [ ] Rewrite evoke-hash with `set -eu`, usage function, and proper error handling.
- [ ] Add tests for update-all and update-wizardry system spells.
- [ ] Remove duplicate spells (war/kill-process, divination/read-contact) or convert to symlinks.
- [ ] Fix `var= ` assignment patterns to `var=''` in 13 affected files.
- [ ] Fix tilde expansion in mark-location (line 41).
- [ ] Fix pattern matching issues in enchant and yaml-to-enchantment spells.
- [ ] Fix typo in README.md ("opinilnsted" → "opinionated").
- [ ] Improve error messages across spells with actionable guidance.
- [ ] Create CONTRIBUTING.md with spell contribution template.
