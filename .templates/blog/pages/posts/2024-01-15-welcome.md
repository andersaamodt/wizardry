# Welcome to My Blog

Hello and welcome! This is my first post on this new blog platform built with wizardry web.

## What is This Blog About?

I'll be writing about topics that interest me, including:
- Technology and programming
- POSIX shell scripting
- Web development
- Decentralized systems

## Why Wizardry Web?

This blog uses a unique approach to web publishing:

- **Filesystem as database**: Posts are just Markdown files
- **Content-addressable**: Each post has a unique content hash
- **Version tracking**: Edits create new versions, old ones preserved
- **Nostr-ready**: Built for future decentralized social integration

## What's Next?

Stay tuned for more posts! You can:
- Browse by [tags](/pages/tags.html)
- Read the [about page](/pages/about.html)
- Check back regularly for new content

Thanks for reading!
