## About This Blog

Welcome to my personal blog. This is a place where I share my thoughts, ideas, and experiences.

## About the Author

Hi, I'm [Your Name]. This blog is where I write about [your topics of interest].

You can find me on:
- [Your social links]
- [Your website]
- [Your email]

## About the Platform

This blog is built with [wizardry web](https://github.com/andersaamodt/wizardry), a unique web platform that:

- Uses POSIX shell scripts for all server-side logic
- Treats the filesystem as the database
- Converts Markdown to HTML with Pandoc
- Provides interactivity through CGI scripts

### Technical Details

- **Posts**: Stored as `.md` files with YAML front-matter
- **Identity**: Each post identified by content hash (SHA-256)
- **Versioning**: Edits create new versions linked to prior versions
- **Tags**: Flat tag system compatible with Nostr
- **Visibility**: Controlled via UNIX file permissions

### Future: Nostr Integration

This blog is architected for future integration with [Nostr](https://nostr.com), a decentralized social protocol:
- Post metadata aligned with Nostr event format
- Content hashes compatible with Nostr event IDs
- Tag system matches Nostr event tagging
- Multi-author extensibility built-in

For now, the blog is read-only. Social interaction will be added when Nostr integration is implemented (Phase 2).
